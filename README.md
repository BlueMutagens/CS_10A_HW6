C++ more switch case practice as well as my first more interactive code

The tennis program simply takes any true tennis points (eg 1 3 is 1 point to 3 points) and outputs the score in tennis terminology (fifteen fourty)

The vend program simulates a vending machine. It gives the user 4 choices of food and their prices, then asks how many dollars, quarters, dimes and nickels they insert
The user then makes a choice and the program outputs "enjoy your [food]" if there are enough funds, "insufficent funds" if there arent,  and "invalid choice" if the user inputs a selection outside of the bounds
